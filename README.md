# Building-a-RAG-model

Overview
This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model with the following steps:

Dependencies: Required libraries such as langchain, langgraph, and other community modules are installed.

Data Preprocessing: Text is split and prepared for RAG using the langchain-text-splitters module.

Model Implementation: The RAG model is built using a pipeline to generate answers based on retrieved documents.

Evaluation: BLEU scores are computed to evaluate model performance before and after applying RAG.

Installation
To install the required packages, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain-text-splitters langchain-community langgraph
Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run all the cells sequentially to process the data and evaluate the model.

Review the BLEU scores to compare the model's performance.

Contents
31 Code Cells: Include data processing, model definition, and evaluation.

3 Markdown Cells: Provide descriptions of the different steps.

Notes
The first markdown section is titled "Dependencies".

The first code cell installs required packages:

python
Copy
Edit
%pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain-text-splitters langchain-community langgraph
Results
BLEU scores are used to compare performance before and after applying the RAG model
